# FrogML
Android Application based on Frog Statue locations found in Erie, PA.  Uses K-means clustering algorithm to determine best route for trips.


This project is unfinished, and currently needs the following elements implemented.

1. Finish Sign In Page and database
2. Reimplement code for machine learning algorithm used to determine trips. Currently needs to be remade due to university account shutting down (thus preventing access to needed code)
3. Use the ML code to present the trip information.


Note: The following is the java and xml code from an android studio project, and will not run on its own. This code is purely for inspection purposes for previous projects.
